# svg-text

**Big idea:** Request an image URL like `svg-text.sign.me.uk/Hello World.svg` and it returns a dynamic SVG.

Trying out <https://www.npmjs.com/package/text-to-svg>

Also maybe <https://www.npmjs.com/package/svg-render> for PNG if needed?

**I did it!** Wow, that took about an hour tops. Open Source is good actually.

## API

### Get an SVG

<https://svg-text.sign.me.uk/Hello%20World.svg>

### Get a PNG

<https://svg-text.sign.me.uk/Hello%20World.png>

## Future

Needs more fonts and background/outline options

Maybe use querystrings for this
